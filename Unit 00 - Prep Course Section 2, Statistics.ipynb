    "Statistics is a branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data.  Statistician Sir Arthur Lyon Bowley defined statistics as, *\"Numerical statements of facts in any department of inquiry placed in relation to each other.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "In applying statistics to a problem, you need to start with a data set that represents a **population** or **process** to be studied, e.g.: \"all people living in a city\", or \"atoms in a substance undergoing beta decay\".  Descriptive statistics is generally concerned with two things:\n",
    "1. **Central Tendency**: attempts to characterise a data set's *central*, or *typical* value.\n",
    "2. **Dispersion**: attempts to characterize how elements of a data set depart from the center/each other."

    "*  **(Arithmetic) Mean**:  this is the term for what we generally call an \"average\".  We add all of the numbers in our data set, and then divide by the size of the set.  Symbolically, if $\\{a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n\\}$ is our data set, then the arithmetic mean (denoted $\\mu$) is computed as $$ \\mu = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^na_i = \\frac{1}{n}(a_1+a_2+\\ldots+a_n). $$\n",
    "* **Median**: for a given data set (of numbers), the median is the number that separates the top half of the data from the bottom half.  If the size of the data set is even )so there is no single data point in the middle), the median is given by the mean of the two middle values, after arranging the data into ascending order.\n",

    "* **Standard Deviation**: the standard deviation is the square root of the variance.  One useful property of the standard deviation is that it is in the same units as the original data set (unlike the variance).  A low standard deviation implies the data set points are clustered near the mean, whereas a high standard deviation implies the data set points tend to be further from the mean.  Symbolically, the standard deviation of $X=\\{x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n\\}$ is given by:\n",

    "## Statistics and Critical Thinking\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic statistical quantities, like those we've learned in this section, are important tools we use to understand data in our lives.  One key thing to remember when presented with statistics is that by distilling large data sets into a few numbers, we are necessarily losing information about the data.  Being told the mean of some large data set is important information, but there's more that needs to be asked before you can get an idea of what the data set is really like.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you were told that the class average of a given class was 60%, you might think \"that sounds reasonable\".  But that's not enough information to tell you about the actual class marks.  Here are three sets of class marks that all have an average of 60%:\n",
    "$$m_1 = \\{27,50,62,70,71,80\\}, $$\n",
    "$$m_2 = \\{30,30,30,90,90,90\\}, $$\n",
    "$$m_3 = \\{60,60,60,60,60,60\\}; $$\n",
    "i.e.: $\\mu_1=\\mu_2=\\mu_3= 60$.  But if we look at the actual marks, we can see that $m_1$ is a fairly reasonable distribution of marks, $m_2$ is not overly likely, and $m_3$ is highly suspect.  Knowing just the average is not enough for us to get an idea of how each data set looks.  The more information we can gather, the better off we are.  The first step would be to ask about the standard deviations, which are computed as:\n",
    "$$ \\sigma_1 \\cong 17, $$\n",
    "$$ \\sigma_2 = 30, $$\n",
    "$$ \\sigma_3 = 0. $$\n",
    "These give us our first clue to the unlikely nature of $m_2$ and $m_3$, since the standard deviation is very high for $m_2$, and a standard deviation of $0$ is an immediate red flag for $m_3$. But again, the standard deviation is just a tool, and knowing $m_1,\\sigma_1$ won't necessarily tell you how many people failed the class in $m_1$.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind the meanings of the statistics you compute, and realize the limitations to understanding they present."
